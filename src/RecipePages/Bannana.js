               <li> Step 1
                 <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter one 9-by-5-inch loaf pan.</p>
               </li>
               <li> Step 2
                 <p>Whisk together the flour, pecans, granulated sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in a large bowl. Whisk together the eggs, melted butter, buttermilk, brown sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl; stir in the mashed bananas. Fold the banana mixture into the flour mixture until just combined</p>
               </li>
               <li> Step 3
                 <p>Pour the batter into the buttered pan and lightly tap the pan on the counter to evenly distribute the batter. Bake until browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out completely clean, about 1 hour. Let the bread cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.

               <h4>Cookâ€™s Note</h4>
               <p>To make this banana bread nut-free, just leave out the pecans and follow the rest of the recipe as written. When measuring flour, we spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level off excess.</p>
