               <li> Step 1
                 <p>Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, until shimmering. 
                     Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until soft and brown, about 5 minutes. 
                     Add the onions and cook stirring, until soft and golden, about 8 minutes. 
                     Add the celery, carrots, peppers and garlic and cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to brown and become fragrant, about 5 minutes. 
                     Stir in the soy sauce, garlic and onion powder, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.</p>
               </li>
               <li> Step 2
                 <p>Add the cabbage to the pot and stir until it begins to wilt, about 2 minutes. 
                     Pour in the crushed tomatoes, chicken broth and 1 cup water. Stir to combine. 
                     Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer and cook until the cabbage is tender, 30 to 45 minutes. 
                     Season with salt and pepper. </p>

                   <h4>Cookâ€™s Note</h4>
                 <p>To speed up vegetable prep you can use a food processor fitted with the grater attachment. 
                     Add any liquid accumulated from the shredded vegetables to the soup along with the broth.
